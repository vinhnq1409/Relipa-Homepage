        "Relipa Co., Ltd. is a system development company headquartered in Hanoi, Vietnam, and was established by three Vietnamese who graduated from Ritsumeikan University in 2016. In 2018, we also launched a Japanese corporation and have consistently provided offshore development specialized for 'Japanese companies' since its establishment.",

        'I had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan when I was 21 years old. As a young student who lived in a developing country like Vietnam and had the opportunity to set foot in a developed country for the first time, I was able to create delicate and perfect public buildings such as Japanese railways that I had never seen in Vietnam. I was really impressed.',
      content3:
        'After graduating, I often go back and forth between the two countries for work, and as I interacted with the people of both countries, I had more opportunities to compare the two countries. While I felt a big gap with my home country, I felt that the gap between Vietnam and Japan was small compared to industrial technology for IT I was studying, so I challenged new technologies in this field, Vietnam in my home country, and I have come to think that I can contribute to Japan as well.',
      content4:
        'After that, I made use of the know-how accumulated in Japanese universities and companies to establish a company with my colleagues. Currently, we are actively conducting research and development on cutting-edge technologies such as AR / VR / AI as well as offshore development.',
      content5:
        "We do not have communication issues of concern in offshore development. There are many engineers who can understand the 'Japanese mind' by living in Japan for a certain period of time, such as studying at a Japanese university and working at a Japanese company, and there are engineers who are fluent in Japanese who can respond to face-to-face requirement definitions. In addition, many of our  engineers are from Vietnam's premier IT universities such as Hanoi University of Science and Technology, and we provide high-quality systems and detailed services with high development technology and sense.",
