        `Our company, Relipa Co., Ltd. is a system development company headquartered in Hanoi, Vietnam, and was established in 2016 by me as founder and 2 co-founders, all are Vietnamese graduated from the University of Science and Technology in Vietnam and Ritsumeikan University in Japan. After 2 years from establishment in 2016, we officially launched a Japanese branch and have consistently provided offshore development services specialized for  Japanese market.`,
        `As a young student in a developing country like Vietnam, when I had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan at the age of 21, I was really impressed by the state-of-the-art technologies and modern facilities in such a developed country which I had never seen in my home country. `,
        `All the very first steps in Japan had made me personally aware of the big gap between 2 countries. On the other hand, throughout my studies in Ritsumeikan University, I surprizingly found that the gap in terms of IT related industrial technologies between Vietnam and Japan was considerably small. This was the reason why I decided to challenge myself in introducing new technologies in this field, so that I can contribute my own knowledge and skills to the development of my home countries Vietnam, Japan and the relationship between 2 countries.`,
        `After graduating, I made use of the know-how accumulated during the course of universities and working experiences from companies to build a company with my colleagues.`,
        `I am really proud of the quality of human resources in Relipa. We have many engineers with a deep understanding of the "Japanese mind", who had been by living in Japan for a certain period of time for studying or working. Besides, our engineers with the ability to use Japanese fluently are confident in responding face-to-face requirement definitions. In addition, as we have many engineers from Vietnam's top-ranked IT universities such as Hanoi University of Science and Technology, we provide high-quality  services with up-to-date technology and continuously updated skills.`,
        `Since February 2020, the Corona virus has spread all over the world and had a great impact on our daily lives. As you become accustomed to the "New normal", in the global trend of digital transformation waves (DX), Relipa will try our best to become your reliable partner.`,
