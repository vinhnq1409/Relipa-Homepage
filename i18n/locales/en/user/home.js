Although we did not require a expertised architecture plan, Relipa provided us a surprizingly suitable development team, as well as develop a prototype with high satisfaction level. Another point I have to mention is that I was very amazed about the quality of the human resource from the company.
        I also impressed that Relipa designed and developed the product that exactly met our requirements and  accessible without any technical indication from our company. That was really amazing. `,

        If GitHub and Slack are used to inform requirements in Japanese, all those requirements would be handled at a amazingly high speed. Moreover, if the requirements given are ambiguous, the company will check carefully by appropriate questions to ensure that there will be no conflict or disagreement exist. 
        Although 1 year of cooperation was somehow short, I was really impressed by the high responding speed, as well as the company had been trying their best to improve speed and quality day after day compared to the first day we joined partnership.`,
